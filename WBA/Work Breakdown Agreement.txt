 Work Breakdown Agreement 
Assignment 1


A meeting was held initially to decide which of us will be doing which task and design and adding any extra features to the current game design.It was decided that the assignment will be broken down into 2 parts. Both of us will be doing the UML Class Diagram and the Design Rationale. There will be daily checkups and meetings over the assignment progress. Each will review the other’s work and comment on it and decide what to add/remove

Kong Man is in Charge of implementing Harvest, Craft, Eat and Zombie limbs dropping features.
